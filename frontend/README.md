# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version 6 or higher) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

    or

    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:
